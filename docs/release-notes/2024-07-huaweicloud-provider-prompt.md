# Release Notes: Huawei Cloud Provider Prompt Blueprint

## Summary
- Added a reusable engineering prompt in `docs/prompts/huaweicloud_provider_prompt.md` to guide AI-assisted development of a Huawei Cloud Terraform provider for TerraCognita.
- Updated the README with a new "Extending to new providers" section that references the prompt for contributors exploring additional cloud support.
- Documented the prompt availability in the project changelog under the Unreleased section.

## Impact
- Contributors now have a curated set of requirements and architectural cues to implement Huawei Cloud support while conforming to TerraCognita's provider model.
- Documentation surfaces the prompt so SREs and platform engineers can quickly discover the onboarding material.

## Next Steps
- Use the prompt as a starting point to scaffold the Huawei Cloud provider implementation.
- Expand the prompt collection for future cloud integrations once the workflow proves useful.
